    Working on Real Project with Python (Big Data Analysis)

    The Weather Dataset
    Hi,The following Weather Dataset is time series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location.It records Temperature, Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure and Conditions.
    The data is available as a CSV file and we will analyze this data set using the Pandas DataFrame.
    
    Importing all important liberaries.
    import pandas as pd
    
    TO Analze the DataFrames we use following functions:
    
    data.head
    data.shape
    data.index
    data.columns
    data.dtypes
    data.unique
    data.nunique
    data.count
    data.value_counts
    data.info
    
    We will solve the following question and anayze this dataset:
    
    1. Find all the unique 'Wind Speeed' values in the data.
    2. Find the numer of times when the 'Weather is exactly Clear'.
    3. Find the number of times when the 'Wind Speed was exaclty 4 km/h'.
    4. Find out all the Null Values in the data.
    5. Rename the column name 'Weather' of the dataframe to 'Weather Condition'.
    6. What is the mean 'Visibility'?
    7. What is the Standard Deviation of 'Pressure' in this data?
    8. What is the Variance of 'Relative Humidity' in this data?
    9. Find all instances when 'Snow' was recorded.
    10. Find all instances when 'Wind Speed is above 24'and 'Visibility is 25'.
    11. What is the Mean value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?
    12. What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition'?
    13. Show all the Records where Weather Condition is Fog.
    14. Find all instances when 'Weather is Clear' or 'Visibility is above 40'.
    15. Find all instances when :
    A. 'Weather is Clear' and 'Relative Humidity is greater than 50'
    or
    
    B. 'Visibility is above 40'
